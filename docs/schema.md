## Table: apptreminderrule

This is called eServices Automated Messaging Rules in the UI. These are used to track the automated generation and sending of appointment reminders and confirmations. Users are allowed to define up to two reminders and one confirmation (per clinic.) These can be sent out any number of Days, Hours, and/or Minutes before a scheduled appointment. PRACTICE - Appointment Reminder Rules will be saved and edited with clinicNum=0. This denotes the "Defaults" when using clinics, but for a practice the defaults become the practice rules.CLINICS - When using clinics, each clinic has a bool "IsConfirmEnabled" that determines if a particular clinic has automated reminders/confirmations enabled. If not, no reminders will be sent out for the clinic. If enabled, and no rules are defined for the clinic, then the clinic will attempt to use the defaults that have been defined with clinicNum==0. If a clinic is enabled and has at least one AppointmentReminderRule defined, then NO defaults will be used for that clinic.REMINDERS - reminders are sent out using the ApptComm system implemented by DG. These used to be stored as preferences for the practice only, now users are allowed to define them on a per clinic basis. Reminders should be considered one way communications and should not be desingned with a customer response in mind.CONFIRMATIONS - confirmations are sent using the new automated-confirmation system implemented by RM (proper) and SO (web backend). Confirmations are intended to allow end patients to respond to OpenDental via text or email and automatically confirm, or set to a desired status, the appointments on the schedule.

## Table: autocode

An autocode automates entering procedures. The user only has to pick composite, for instance, and the autocode figures out the code based on the number of surfaces, and posterior vs. anterior. Autocodes also enforce and suggest changes to a procedure code if the number of surfaces or other properties change.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | AutoCodeNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | Description | varchar(255) |  | Displays meaningful decription, like "Amalgam". |
| 2 | IsHidden | tinyint |  | User can hide autocodes |
| 3 | LessIntrusive | tinyint |  | This will be true if user no longer wants to see this autocode message when closing a procedure. This makes it less intrusive, but it can still be used in procedure buttons. |

## Table: benefit

Corresponds to the benefit table in the database which replaces the old covpat table. A benefit is usually a percentage, deductible, limitation, max, or similar. Each row represents a single benefit. A benefit can have a value in EITHER PlanNum OR PatPlanNum. If it is for a PlanNum, the most common, then the benefit is attached to an insurance plan. If it is for a PatPlanNum, then it overrides the plan benefit, usually a percentage, for a single patient. Benefits we can't handle yet include posterior composites, COB duplication, amounts used, in/out of plan network, authorization required, missing tooth exclusion, and any date related limitations like waiting periods.Here are examples of typical usage which parallel X12 usage.Example fields shown in this order:CovCat, ProcCode(- indicates blank), BenefitType, Percent, MonetaryAmt, TimePeriod, QuantityQualifier, Quantity, CoverageLevelAnnual Max Indiv $1000: None/General,-,Limitations,-1,1000,CalendarYear,None,0,IndividualRestorative 80%: Restorative,-,CoInsurance,80,-1,CalendarYear,None,0,None$50 deductible: None/General,-,Deductible,-1,50,CalendarYear,None,0,IndividualDeductible waived on preventive: Preventive,-,Deductible,-1,0,CalendarYear,None,0,Individual1 pano every 5 years: None,D0330,Limitations,-1,-1,Years?,Years,5,None2 exams per year: Preventive(or Diagnostic),-,Limitations,-1,-1,BenefitYear,NumberOfServices,2,NoneFluoride limit 18yo: None, D1204, Limitations, -1, -1, CalendarYear/None, AgeLimit, 18,None (might require a second identical entry for D1205)4BW every 6 months: None, D0274, Limitations, -1, -1, None, Months, 6,None.The text above might be difficult to read. We are trying to improve the white spacing.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | BenefitNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PlanNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to insplan. FK to insplan.PlanNum. Most benefits should be attached using PlanNum. The exception would be if each patient has a different percentage. If PlanNum is used, then PatPlanNum should be 0. |
| 2 | PatPlanNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patplan. FK to patplan.PatPlanNum. It is rare to attach benefits this way. Usually only used to override percentages for patients. In this case, PlanNum should be 0. |
| 3 | CovCatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to covcat. FK to covcat.CovCatNum. Corresponds to X12 EB03- Service Type code. Situational, so it can be 0. Will probably be 0 for general deductible and annual max. There are very specific categories covered by X12. Users should set their InsCovCats to the defaults we provide. |
| 4 | BenefitType | tinyint |  | Enum:InsBenefitType Corresponds to X12 EB01. Examples: 0=ActiveCoverage, 1=CoInsurance, 2=Deductible, 3=CoPayment, 4=Exclusions, 5=Limitations. ActiveCoverage doesn't really provide meaningful information.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• ActiveCoverage (0- Informational only. Not usually used.  Would only be used if you are just indicating that the patient is covered, but without any specifics.)<br>• CoInsurance (1- Used for percentages to indicate portion that insurance will cover.  When interpreting electronic benefit information, this is the opposite percentage, the percentage that the patient will pay after deductible.)<br>• Deductible (2- The deductible amount.  Might be two entries if, for instance, deductible is waived on preventive.)<br>• CoPayment (3- Informational only. A dollar amount.)<br>• Exclusions (4- Services that are simply not covered at all.)<br>• Limitations (5- Covers a variety of limitations, including Max, frequency, fee reductions, etc.)<br>• WaitingPeriod (6- Sets a period of time after the effective date where a benefit will not be used.) |
| 5 | Percent | tinyint(4) |  | Only used if BenefitType=CoInsurance. Valid values are 0 to 100. -1 indicates empty, which is almost always true if not CoInsurance. The percentage that insurance will pay on the procedure. Note that benefits coming from carriers are usually backwards, indicating the percentage that the patient is responsible for. |
| 6 | MonetaryAmt | double |  | Used for CoPayment, Limitations, and Deductible. -1 indicates empty |
| 7 | TimePeriod | tinyint |  | Enum:BenefitTimePeriod Corresponds to X12 EB06, Time Period Qualifier. Examples: 0=None,1=ServiceYear,2=CalendarYear,3=Lifetime,4=Years. Might add Visit and Remaining.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0- A timeperiod is frequenly not needed.  For example, percentages.)<br>• ServiceYear (1- The renewal month is not Jan.  In this case, we need to know the effective date so that we know which month the benefits start over in.)<br>• CalendarYear (2- Renewal month is Jan.)<br>• Lifetime (3- Usually used for ortho max.)<br>• Years (4- Wouldn't be used alone.  Years would again be specified in the quantity field along with a number.)<br>• NumberInLast12Months (5- # in last 12 months.  Does not care about when benefit year begins. Looks at previous 12 months.) |
| 8 | QuantityQualifier | tinyint |  | Enum:BenefitQuantity Corresponds to X12 EB09. Not used very much. Examples: 0=None,1=NumberOfServices,2=AgeLimit,3=Visits,4=Years,5=Months<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0- This is used a lot. Most benefits do not need any sort of quantity.)<br>• NumberOfServices (1- For example, two exams per year)<br>• AgeLimit (2- For example, 18 when fluoride only covered to 18 y.o.)<br>• Visits (3- For example, copay per 1 visit.)<br>• Years (4- For example, pano every 5 years.)<br>• Months (5- For example, BWs every 6 months.) |
| 9 | Quantity | tinyint |  | Corresponds to X12 EB10. Qualify the quantity using QuantityQualifier. |
| 10 | CodeNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to procedurecode. FK to procedurecode.CodeNum. Typical uses include fluoride, sealants, etc. If a specific code is used here, then the CovCat should be None. |
| 11 | CoverageLevel | int(11) |  | Enum:BenefitCoverageLevel Corresponds to X12 EB02. None, Individual, or Family. Individual and Family are commonly used for deductibles and maximums. None is commonly used for percentages and copays.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0- Since this is a situational X12 field, we can also have none.  Typical for percentages and copayments.)<br>• Individual (1- The default for deductibles and maximums.)<br>• Family (2- For example, family deductible or family maximum.) |
| 12 | SecDateTEntry | datetime |  | Timestamp automatically generated and user not allowed to change. The actual date of entry. |
| 13 | SecDateTEdit | timestamp |  | Automatically updated by MySQL every time a row is added or changed. |
| 14 | CodeGroupNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to codegroup. FK to codegroup.CodeGroupNum The group of procedure codes that apply to this frequency limitation benefit. |
| 15 | TreatArea | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:TreatmentArea . Only for frequency limitations, ignored for all other benefits. Enforced by the UI. Example 3 fillings per year [mouth]. Tests: 140 through 147. 0 means default.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0-goes on claims as blank.)<br>• Surf (1)<br>• Tooth (2)<br>• Mouth (3-goes on claims as 00.)<br>• Quad (4)<br>• Sextant (5)<br>• Arch (6)<br>• ToothRange (7) |

This will override the EraAutomationBehavior preference when not set to UseGlobal.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• UseGlobal (0 - Never used for the EraAutomationBehavior preference. Only used for Carrier.EraAutomationOverride to indicate that the carrier uses the EraAutomationBehavior preference instead of an override.)<br>• ReviewAll (1 - ERAs are manually processed.)<br>• SemiAutomatic (2 - Allows ERAs to be processed with a single button click.)<br>• FullyAutomatic (3 - When ERAs are imported, they are fully processed without any input from a user.) |
| 26 | OrthoInsPayConsolidate | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumOrthoInsPayConsolidate Global (0) by default. Determines how this carrier requires payments made to ortho claims made by the Auto Ortho Tool. This will override the OrthoInsPayConsolidated preference when not set to Global.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• Global (Uses the preference value of OrthoInsPayConsolidated.)<br>• ForceConsolidateOn (Overrides the preference value of OrthoInsPayConsolidated and blocks users from entering payments on claims created by the Auto Ortho Tool.)<br>• ForceConsolidateOff (Overrides the preference value of OrthoInsPayConsolidated and allows users to enter payments on claims created by the Auto Ortho Tool.) |

| 51 | CanadaTransRefNum | varchar(255) |  | G01 assigned by carrier/network and returned in acks. Used for claim reversal. For Claim Acknowledgements, this can sometimes be a series of spaces, which means the number is effectively empty.

Defaults to PatNum/ClaimNum, but can be edited by user, and is often modified by the clearinghouse to ensure uniqueness on their end. This also set for PreAuth claims. The ClaimIdentifier for a PreAuth will probably not match the ClaimIdentifier for a regular claim, which makes ERA claim matching more straight forward for both PreAuths and regular claims. |
| 69 | OrigRefNum | varchar(255) |  | X12 2300 REF (F8). Used when resending claims to refer to the original claim. The user must type this value in after reading it from the original claim response report. |

## Table: claimpayment

Each row represents a single check from the insurance company. The amount may be split between patients using claimprocs. The amount of the check must always exactly equal the sum of all the claimprocs attached to it. There might be only one claimproc.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | ClaimPaymentNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | CheckDate | date |  | Date the check was entered into this system, not the date on the check. |

| 3 | CheckNum | varchar(25) |  | The check number. |
| 4 | BankBranch | varchar(25) |  | Bank and branch. |

## Table: claimproc

Links procedures to claims. Also links ins payments to procedures or claims. Also used for estimating procedures even if no claim yet. Warning: One proc might be linked twice to a given claim if insurance made two payments. Many of the important fields are actually optional. For instance, ProcNum is only required if itemizing ins payment, and ClaimNum is blank if Status=adjustment,cap,or estimate.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | ClaimProcNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | ProcNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to procedurelog. FK to procedurelog.ProcNum. Is 0 for payments by total or for Canadian Carrier Issued Procedures. |
| 2 | ClaimNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to claim. FK to claim.ClaimNum. Is 0 for estimates, adjustments and capitation (CapClaim and CapComplete). |
| 3 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. Must always match claim.PatNum |
| 4 | ProvNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to provider. FK to provider.ProvNum. |
| 5 | FeeBilled | double |  | Fee billed to insurance. Might not be the same as the actual fee. The fee billed can be different than the actual procedure. For instance, if you have set the insurance plan to bill insurance using UCR fees, then this field will contain the UCR fee instead of the fee that the patient was charged. |
| 6 | InsPayEst | double |  | Actual amount this carrier is expected to pay, after taking everything else into account. Considers annual max, override, percentAmt, copayAmt, deductible, etc. This estimate is computed automatically when sent to ins. |
| 7 | DedApplied | double |  | 0 if blank. Deductible applied to this procedure only. Only for procedures attached to claims. Otherwise, the DedEst and DedEstOverride are used. |
| 8 | Status | tinyint |  | Enum:ClaimProcStatus . When setting recieved\supplemental must set DateEntry.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• NotReceived (0: For claims that have been created or sent, but have not been received.)<br>• Received (1: For claims that have been received.)<br>• Preauth (2: For preauthorizations.)<br>• Adjustment (3: The only place that this status is used is to make adjustments to benefits from the coverage window.  It is never attached to a claim.)<br>• Supplemental (4:This differs from Received only slightly.  It's for additional payments on procedures already received.  Most fields are blank.)<br>• CapClaim (5: CapClaim is used when you want to send a claim to a capitation insurance company.  These are similar to Supplemental in that there will always be a duplicate claimproc for a procedure. The first claimproc tracks the copay and writeoff, has a status of CapComplete, and is never attached to a claim. The second claimproc has status of CapClaim.)<br>• Estimate (6: Estimates have replaced the fields that were in the procedure table.  Once a procedure is complete, the claimprocstatus will still be Estimate.  An Estimate can be attached to a claim and status gets changed to NotReceived.)<br>• CapComplete (7: For capitation procedures that are complete.  This replaces the old procedurelog.CapCoPay field. This stores the copay and writeoff amounts.  The copay is only there for reference, while it is the writeoff that actually affects the balance. Never attached to a claim. If procedure is TP, then status will be CapEstimate.  Only set to CapComplete if procedure is Complete.)<br>• CapEstimate (8: For capitation procedures that are still estimates rather than complete.  When procedure is completed, this can be changed to CapComplete, but never to anything else.)<br>• InsHist (9: For InsHist procedures.) |
| 9 | InsPayAmt | double |  | Amount insurance actually paid. |
| 10 | Remarks | varchar(255) |  | The remarks that insurance sends in the EOB about procedures. |
| 11 | ClaimPaymentNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to claimpayment. FK to claimpayment.ClaimPaymentNum(the insurance check). |
| 12 | PlanNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to insplan. FK to insplan.PlanNum |
| 13 | DateCP | date |  | This is the date that is used for payment reports and tracks the payment date. Once a payment has been attached, the DateCP will exactly match the date of the ClaimPayment it's attached to. See the note under Ledgers.ComputePayments. This will eventually not be used for aging. The ProcDate will instead be used. See ProcDate. |
| 14 | WriteOff | double |  | Amount not covered by ins which is written off. The writeoff estimate goes in a different column. This is filled with the WriteOffEst value when a claim is created. |
| 15 | CodeSent | varchar(15) |  | The procedure code that was sent to insurance. This is not necessarily the usual procedure code. It will already have been trimmed to 5 char if it started with "D", or it could be the alternate code. Not allowed to be blank if it is procedure. |
| 16 | AllowedOverride | double |  | The allowed fee (not the override) is a complex calculation which is performed on the fly in Procedure.ComputeEstimates/ClaimProc.ComputeBaseEst. It is the amount that the percentage is based on. If this carrier has a lower UCR than the office, then the allowed fee is where that is handled. It can be pulled from an allowed fee schedule. It is also where substitutions for posterior composites are handled. The AllowedOverride allows the user to override the calculation. -1 indicates blank. A new use of this field is for when entering insurance payments. On the eob, it will tell you what the allowed/UCR fee is. The user will now be able to enter this information into the AllowedOverride field. They will simultaneously pass the info to the allowed fee schedule. AllowedOverride is never changed automatically by the program except to sometimes set it to -1 if NoBillIns. |
| 17 | Percentage | tinyint(4) |  | -1 if blank. Otherwise a number between 0 and 100. The percentage that insurance pays on this procedure, as determined from insurance categories. Not user editable. |
| 18 | PercentOverride | tinyint(4) |  | -1 if blank. Otherwise a number between 0 and 100. Can only be changed by user. |
| 19 | CopayAmt | double |  | -1 if blank. Calculated automatically. User cannot edit but can use CopayOverride instead. Opposite of InsEst, because this is the patient portion estimate. Two different uses: 1. For capitation, this automates calculation of writeoff. 2. For any other insurance, it gets deducted during calculation as shown in the edit window. Neither use directly affects patient balance. |
| 20 | NoBillIns | tinyint |  | Set to true to not bill to this insurance plan. |
| 21 | PaidOtherIns | double |  | -1 if blank. The amount paid or estimated to be paid by another insurance. This amount is then subtracted from what the current insurance would pay. When running the calculation and considering other claimprocs, it will ignore any patPlan with a higher ordinal. So, always blank for primary claims. User cannot edit, but can use PaidOtherInsOverride. |
| 22 | BaseEst | double |  | Always has a value. Used in TP, etc. The base estimate is the ((fee or allowedOverride)-Copay) x (percentage or percentOverride). Does not include all the extras like ded, annualMax,and paidOtherIns that InsEstTotal holds. BaseEst cannot be overridden by the user. Instead, the following fields can be manipulated: allowedOverride, CopayOverride, PercentOverride. |
| 23 | CopayOverride | double |  | -1 if blank. See description of CopayAmt. This lets the user set a copay that will never be overwritten by automatic calculations. |
| 24 | ProcDate | date |  | Date of the procedure. Displayed in Edit Claim window procedures grid. Currently only used for tracking annual insurance benefits remaining. Important in Adjustments to benefits. For total claim payments, MUST be the date of the procedures to correctly figure benefits. Will eventually transition to use this field to actually calculate aging. See the note under Ledgers.ComputePayments. |
| 25 | DateEntry | date |  | Date that it was changed to status received or supplemental. It is usually attached to a claimPayment at that point, but not if user forgets. This is still the date that it becomes important financial data. Only applies if Received or Supplemental. Otherwise, the date is disregarded. User may never edit. Important in audit trail. |
| 26 | LineNumber | tinyint |  | Assigned when claim is created as a way to order the procs showing on a claim. Indireclty goes out in X12 loop 2400. Used in Canadian eclaims (field F07). One based index. Is zero for total payments. |
| 27 | DedEst | double |  | -1 if blank. Not sure why we need to allow -1. Calculated automatically. User cannot edit, but can use DedEstOverride instead. |
| 28 | DedEstOverride | double |  | -1 if blank. Overrides the DedEst value. |
| 29 | InsEstTotal | double |  | Always has a value. BaseEst-(DedEst or DedEstOverride)-PaidOtherIns-OverAnnualMax. User cannot edit, but can instead use InsEstTotalOverride. Recalculated each time TP is viewed, is saved as the value calculated for the last viewed TP. This variable should probably just be moved to memory and removed as a DB field. |
| 30 | InsEstTotalOverride | double |  | -1 if blank. Overrides the InsEstTotal value. |
| 31 | PaidOtherInsOverride | double |  | -1 if blank. Overrides the PaidOtherIns value. |
| 32 | EstimateNote | varchar(255) |  | An automatically generated note that displays information about over max, exclusions, and other limitations for which there are no fields. Only applies to estimate. Once it's attached to a claim, similar information can go in the remarks field. |
| 33 | WriteOffEst | double |  | -1 if blank. The estimated writeoff as calculated by OD. Usually only used for PPOs. |
| 34 | WriteOffEstOverride | double |  | -1 if blank. Overrides WriteOffEst. Usually only used for PPOs. |
| 35 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. Can be zero. No user interface for editing. Forced to always be the same as the procedure, or if no procedure, then the claim. |
| 36 | InsSubNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to inssub. FK to inssub.InsSubNum. |
| 37 | PaymentRow | int(11) |  | 1-indexed. Allows user to sort the order of payments on an EOB. All claimprocs for a payment will have the same PaymentRow value. |
| 38 | PayPlanNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to payplan. FK to payplan.PayPlanNum. 0 if not attached to a payplan. |
| 39 | ClaimPaymentTracking | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum. Connected to the ClaimPaymentTracking DefCat. |
| 40 | SecUserNumEntry | bigint(20) |  | FK to userod. FK to userod.UserNum. Set to the user logged in when the row was inserted at SecDateEntry date and time. |
| 41 | SecDateEntry | date |  | Timestamp automatically generated and user not allowed to change. The actual date of entry. |
| 42 | SecDateTEdit | timestamp |  | Automatically updated by MySQL every time a row is added or changed. Could be changed due to user editing, custom queries or program updates. Not user editable with the UI. |
| 43 | DateSuppReceived | date |  | The date the claim proc was first set to received or supplemental. If status is set to something other than received/supplemental, this field will be set to DateTime.MinValue if DateSuppReceived is today. If DateSuppReceived is set to a day in the past and the status is changed from received/supplemental to something else, the field will not be cleared or updated. Db only field used by one customer and this is how they requested it. PatNum #19191 |
| 44 | DateInsFinalized | date |  | Date of the first claimPayment for this claim. |
| 45 | IsTransfer | tinyint(4) |  | Bool, defaults to false. When true, indicates that a claimproc is part of a transfer from a claim. |
| 46 | ClaimAdjReasonCodes | varchar(255) |  | Holds a comma delimited list of Claim Adjustment Reason Codes from an ERA. https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes |
| 47 | IsOverpay | tinyint(4) |  | Bool, defaults to false. When true, Status is NotReceived and indicates that the claimproc represents an insurance overpayment OR underpayment. |
| 48 | SecurityHash | varchar(255) |  | Holds the salted hash of the following claimproc fields: ClaimNum, Status, InsPayEst, InsPayAmt. |

## Table: clockevent

One clock-in / clock-out pair. Or, if the pair is a break, then it's an out/in pair. With normal clock in/out pairs, we want to know how long the employee was working. It's the opposite with breaks. We want to know how long they were not working, so the pair is backwards. This means that a normal clock in is left incomplete when the clock out for break is created. And once both are finished, the regular in/out will surround the break. Breaks cannot be viewed easily on the same grid as regular clock events for this reason. And since breaks do not affect pay, they should not clutter the normal grid.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |

| 11 | SigIsTopaz | tinyint |  | True if the signature is in Topaz format rather than OD format. |
| 12 | Signature | text |  | The encrypted and bound signature in base64 format. The signature is bound to the byte sequence of the original image. |
| 13 | CropX | int(11) |  | Crop rectangle X. May be negative. First, image is rotated as needed around center. Then, clipped to this crop rectangle. X-Y is center of the crop rectangle relative to center of the image, and where positive is to the upper right of the center of the image. |
| 14 | CropY | int(11) |  | Crop rectangle Y. May be negative. First, image is rotated as needed around center. Then, clipped to this crop rectangle. X-Y is center of the crop rectangle relative to center of the image, and where positive is to the upper right of the center of the image. |
| 15 | CropW | int(11) |  | Crop rectangle Width in original image pixel scale. May be zero if no cropping. May be greater than original image width. |
| 16 | CropH | int(11) |  | Crop rectangle Height in original image pixel scale. May be zero if no cropping. May be greater than original image height. |
| 17 | WindowingMin | int(11) |  | The lower value of the "windowing" (contrast/brightness) for radiographs. Default is 0. Max is 255. |
| 18 | WindowingMax | int(11) |  | The upper value of the "windowing" (contrast/brightness) for radiographs. Default is 0(no windowing). Max is 255. For 12 bit images with a max of 4096, the same max of 255 is used here, but it's just scaled proportionally (x16). |
| 19 | MountItemNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to mountitem. FK to mountitem.MountItemNum. If set, then this image will only show on a mount, not in the main tree. If set to 0, then no mount item is associated with this document. |

| 25 | ProvNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to provider. FK to provider.ProvNum. Optional. Used for radiographs. |
| 26 | IsCropOld | tinyint |  | Set to true as part of conversion to 21.4. Set back to false once the crop is converted to the new scheme. It would take too long to do this conversion in the normal script because it involves loading each image to obtain width and height. So this is a lazy conversion. |
| 27 | OcrResponseData | text |  | Stores a JSON serialized OcrInsScanResponse object. The type of this object is defined by the OcrCaptureType. |
| 28 | ImageCaptureType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumOcrCaptureType 0=Miscellaneous, 1=PrimaryInsFront, 2=PrimaryInsBack, 3=SecondaryInsFront, 4=SecondaryInsBack.

| 1 | DateCreated | date |  | Date created. |
| 2 | FileName | varchar(255) |  | The name the file would have if it was not in the database. Does not include any directory info. DocumentMisc rows that store the contents of the UpdateFiles folder will set this column to an "item order". Due to severe limitations with sending large amounts of data all in one query we are going to store the UpdateFiles over several rows. The FileName column will store the order of which the UpdateFiles need to go back into when we try to reconstruct it. |

UpdateFiles<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• UpdateFiles (0- There will just be zero or one row of this type.  It will contain a zipped archive.)<br>• UpdateFilesSegment (1- Entries with this doc type hold segments of the UpdateFiles RawBase64 zip contents that will be pieced back together later.
            Storing the entire Update Files contents into one row was exceeding MySQL max_allowed_packet limitations so this new type is required.
            Each row of this type will contain ~1MB of RawBase64 data.)<br>• ShareScreenExeSegment (2- Entires of this doc type are segments of OpenDentalShareScreen.exe from our website.
            File names are formatted like version{guid}segment# (ex 12.11.2022.501{45e744a7-f6dd-4e55-9f9f-11d1f746eefe}13).
            An OpenDentalShareScreen.exe is complete when a record is present without a segment# (ex 12.11.2022.501{45e744a7-f6dd-4e55-9f9f-11d1f746eefe}).) |

## Table: eclipboardimagecapture

Linker table between patients and the images they have submitted to the office via eClipboard. Lets office know when a patient last submitted a certain image. Is used in conjuction with EClipboardImageCaptureDef table to allow offices to set frequencies for how often patients should submit certain images, similar to sheets.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | EClipboardImageCaptureNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. |
| 2 | DefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to def. FK to def.DefNum. Should match a DefNum that that is in the in 'EClipboard Images' defcat. Will be zero when IsSelfPortrait. |
| 3 | IsSelfPortrait | tinyint(4) |  | Using DefNum to identify the self portrait is unreliable as the image category that is used to store self portraits may change. Instead, set this field to true for any image capture that is a self portrait. Only for self-portraits tied to the pref 'EClipboardAllowSelfPortraitOnCheckIn', not 'eClipboard Images' defcat. |
| 4 | DateTimeUpserted | datetime |  | Records the date and time the patient took the image. If patient has submitted this eclipboard image before, then we simply update the DateUpserted field and DocNum field. We do not insert an entirely new record. |

## Table: eclipboardsheetdef

Holds settings for eClipboard. Each row is attached to one SheetDef or EFormDef. This table might typically only have 3 to 4 rows in it. There could be more for different clinics. This information helps the software decide whether or not to display a sheet or eForm for a specific patient based on certain criteria. Examples include MinAge, MaxAge, and ResubmitInterval. Forms will also end up on the eClipboard if their sheet.ShowInTerminal is non-zero or eForm.Status=ReadyForPatientFill.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | EClipboardSheetDefNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | SheetDefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to sheetdef. FK to SheetDef.SheetDefNum. Can be zero if this row is for an eForm. |
| 2 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. 0 if no clinic or if default clinic. |
| 3 | ResubmitInterval | bigint(20) |  | If Frequency is EnumEClipFreq.TimeSpan, this will indicate the acceptable amount of time (measured in Years and Months) that can pass since the last time the patient has filled this form out. Once this has elapsed, if the EClipboardCreateMissingFormsOnCheckIn pref is turned on, this form will automatically be added to the patient forms to fill out when the patient is checked in. |
| 4 | ItemOrder | int(11) |  | The order in which the patient will be asked to fill out this form. |
| 5 | PrefillStatus | tinyint(4) |  | Determines how forms will be shown in eClipboard, fresh copy or last available filled out version. |
| 6 | MinAge | int(11) |  | Indicates the minimum age of the patient to be given the form to fill out. If their age is below the minimum limit, they will not be given the form to fill out. A value of -1 means ignore any age requirements. |
| 7 | MaxAge | int(11) |  | Indicates the maximum age of the patient to be given the form to fill out. If their age is over or equal to this maximum limit, they will not be given the form to fill out. A value of -1 means ignore any age requirements. |
| 8 | IgnoreSheetDefNums | text |  | Comma delimited list of sheetdef nums to ignore. This can only be set if the preFillStatus is set to Once. These sheetDefs are ignored until this sheet is filled out. For example, an office may have a sheet for new patients that is only filled out once. Once the new patient has filled out this sheet, these sheetDefs will no longer be ignored when the patient checks in again. Not used in eForms because we have conditional fields, so a single form could be designed to be used for both new and existing patients. |
| 9 | PrefillStatusOverride | bigint(20) |  | For both Sheets and eForms. Holds the previous revision number that marks what def revision number we expect to have a submission for from the patient. This value can be incremented when changes are made to a linked sheet or eForm def, but it is not always updated. This should hold the last revision number that was updated for this eClipboardSheetDef. If a patient has a form filled out that has a revision ID that matches this or is greater (this field will be 0 by default, or they filled out a more up to date form manually in the office and not through eClipboard), then this form will be filtered out if set to EnumEClipFreq.Once when we determine which forms load for the patient in eClipboard. If this value is higher than the RevID of the last form the patient filled out, we consider this eClipboardSheetDef to be updated and the patient will need to fill out the form again when set to EnumEClipFreq.Once. |
| 10 | EFormDefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to eformdef. FK to EFormDef.EFormDefNum. Can be zero if this row is for a sheet. |
| 11 | Frequency | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumEClipFreq 0=Once, 1=EachTime, 2=TimeSpan. The frequency that a form will be submitted by patients. ResubmitInterval can only be set if Frequency is TimeSpan.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• Once (0 - Each patient will submit this form or image capture exactly one time.)<br>• EachTime (1 - Each patient will submit this form or image capture at every visit.)<br>• TimeSpan (2 - Each patient will submit this form or image capture based on a specified time span measured in Years and Months.) |

## Table: eform

EForms is a way for patients to fill out forms. This is similar to sheets, but optimized for dynamic layout instead of fixed layout. The office sets up templates, EFormDefs, which get copied to EForms. Each EForm is linked to one patient.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | EFormNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | FormType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumEFormType 0=PatientForm, 1=MedicalHistory, 2=Consent. This doesn't actually do anything, and all fields are available for all types, but that might eventually change if more types are added.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• PatientForm (0 - Includes patient information and insurance information.)<br>• MedicalHistory (1 - )<br>• Consent (2 - .) |
| 2 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to o patient. FKey to patient.PatNum. |
| 3 | DateTimeShown | datetime |  | The date and time that show in the UI. |
| 4 | Description | varchar(255) |  | The title of the EForm. Copied from EFormDef.Description. |
| 5 | DateTEdited | datetime |  | The date and time when the EForm was lasted edited. Not editable by the user in the UI. |
| 6 | MaxWidth | int(11) |  | Required. Can be any value between 50 and 1000. On wide screens, this limits the width of the form. This is needed on pretty much anything other than a phone. Makes it look consistent across devices and prevents useless white space. Default 450. |
| 7 | EFormDefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to o eformdef. FKey to eformdef.EFormDefNum. This is only used alongside the eClipboardSheetDef table to determine if the patient has filled out that form yet. It's also used with the RevID to prefill fields that don't use a DbLink by pulling from a previous form. I think this also requires using the ReportableName for those fields. |
| 8 | Status | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumEFormStatus 0-None, 1-ShowInEClipboard, 2-Filled, 3-Imported. In the None status, the office might be filling in the tooth number on a consent form. In the ReadyForPatientFill status, it will show in eClipboard. Sheets uses ShowInTerminal for this purpose. Once the patient has filled it, the status is changed to Filled. Sheets uses IsWebForm for this purpose. A Filled eForm will then be imported automatically and the status changed to Imported. If the import process could not match to a known patient, then this status will be UnmatchedToPatient and the PatNum will remain 0 until user matches it.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0 - If a form is added manually in OD proper and then filled out by the patient in OD proper, it will remain this status unless it gets imported.)<br>• ShowInEClipboard (1 - Forms with this status will show in eClipboard. Unlike sheets, there is no way to set order.)<br>• Filled (2 - This status gets set from eClipboard after filling.)<br>• Imported (3 - .)<br>• UnmatchedToPatient (4 - Import was attempted, but could not match a known patient in the database. Once it's matched to a patient, it gets converted to Imported status.) |
| 9 | RevID | int(11) |  | Revision ID. Used to determine in conjunction with PrefillStatus for eClipboardSheetDef to determine whether to show a patient a new form or have them update their last filled out form. Must match up with EFormDef RevID to show a previously filled out form. |
| 10 | ShowLabelsBold | tinyint(4) |  | If true, then this form will show labels at 95% and slightly bold. This looks good, but some users might not want it for certain forms, so it's an option. This applies to text, date, radiobuttons, and sigBox. It does not apply to types label, checkbox, or medicationList. |
| 11 | SpaceBelowEachField | int(11) |  | The amount of space below each field. Overrides the global default and can be overridden by field.SpaceBelow. -1 indicates to use default. That way, 0 means 0 space. |
| 12 | SpaceToRightEachField | int(11) |  | The amount of space to the right of each field. Overrides the global default and can be overridden by field.SpaceToRight. -1 indicates to use default. That way, 0 means 0 space. |
| 13 | SaveImageCategory | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum. This gets set when an EForm is created from an EFormDef. 0 for none or else it's set to an image category. User can change it. It only saves during the import process or if user saves manually. |

## Table: eformdef

EForms are a way for patients to fill out forms. This is similar to sheets, but optimized for dynamic layout instead of fixed layout. The office sets up templates, EFormDefs, which get copied to EForms. Since this is a template EForm, it does not link to a patient. It can be freely changed without affecting any EForms. We also supply internal EFormDefs, which are hard coded as XML rather than being in any office database.

| 6 | RevID | int(11) |  | Revision ID. Gets updated any time an eForm field is added or deleted from an eFormDef (this includes any time a translation is changed). Used to determine in conjunction with PrefillStatus for eClipboardSheetDef to determine whether to show a patient a new form or have them update their last filled out form. Must match up with EForm RevID to show a previously filled out form. |
| 7 | ShowLabelsBold | tinyint(4) |  | If true, then this form will show labels at 95% and slightly bold. This looks good, but some users might not want it for certain forms, so it's an option. This applies to text, date, radiobuttons, and sigBox. It does not apply to types label, checkbox, or medicationList. |

| 9 | SpaceToRightEachField | int(11) |  | The amount of space to the right of each field. Overrides the global default and can be overridden by field.SpaceToRight. -1 indicates to use default. That way, 0 means 0 space. |
| 10 | SaveImageCategory | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum. There is a global setting to save forms to the image category which has ItemVal set to "U". We completely ignore that and it will only work for sheets. If this is 0, it will not save to images. Copied to EForm child. |

Individual fields for EForm. Each field generally includes a label and a value. Links to a EForm by FKey to eform.EFormNum. NOTE: If any new fields get added to this class and EFormFieldDef, make sure to add them to the methods EFormFields.FromDef and EFormFields.ToDef

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | EFormFieldNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | EFormNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to o eform. FKey to eform.EFormNum |
| 2 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to o patient. FKey to patient.PatNum to let us quickly grab all for a patient, and then loop later. |
| 3 | FieldType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EFormFieldType 0-TextField, 1-Label, 2-DateField, etc. |
| 4 | DbLink | varchar(255) |  | If this field is importable, then this links to a db field. The list of available fields for each type is in EFormFieldsAvailable. Users can pick from that list. Identical list as in Sheets. It's string-based instead of enum, just like Sheets, because it's too complex to use an enum, even for our reduced number of items. None is always represented in UI as "None" and in db as empty string. All DbLinks are available on all form types to give users more flexibility. Checkboxes can have DBLinks that look like "allergy:..." or "problem:..." |
| 5 | ValueLabel | text |  | Used differently for different types: TextField, DateField, CheckBox: The label next to or above the textbox, or checkbox.RadioButtons: This label next to or above the group of radiobuttons. Labels on each radiobutton are in PickListVis.Label: This label is the only thing that shows. A label is always a WPF FlowDocument, which is an XML format. This allows extensive rich text formatting, like bold, color, paragraph formatting, etc. This format can be used directly in OD proper, but it will need to be converted for some other programming languages using external tools. BUT, prior to that, it must be run through a method that adjusts all the font sizes. FlowDocuments only support absolute font sizes instead of relative font sizes. We use 11.5 as the base font size and all other fonts are considered to be relative to this base. So if a font size of 13.8 is present in the FlowDocument, that does not mean to use 13.8; it instead means to use 120%. If your chosen base font size on a mobile device is 16, then the conversion method needs to convert the 13.8 to 19.2 prior to using the FlowDocument.PageBreak: Not used.SigBox: Optional label above sig box.MedicationList: This holds an EFormMedListLayout object, serialized as json, including the Title, column headers, column widths, etc. |
| 6 | ValueString | text |  | The data as entered by patient or pulled from the db. We do not need this in EFormFieldDef because that has no patient or db data. Used differently for different types: TextField: value in textBox. For allergiesOther, medsOther, and problemsOther, this is a comma-delimited list. Spaces by commas are ok. Like this: "Aspirin, Iodine, Latex"Label: Not used because no patient input.DateField: date in culture format, like 4/25/2024.Checkbox: "X" or blank "".RadioButton: String value chosen by patient. Pulled from PickListDb, not PickListVis. When importing, empty signifies that patient did not enter any choice, so do not import.ComboBox (not yet added): String value chosen by patient.SigBox: First char is 0 for our sigbox and 1 for Topaz. The remainder is the signature string. See OpenDentBusiness\UI\SignatureBoxWrapper.cs for details. Same format as used for all signatures in OD. Does not get imported.MedicationList: This holds a list of EFormMed objects, serialized as json. |
| 7 | ItemOrder | int(11) |  | 0 based. |
| 8 | PickListVis | varchar(255) |  | Pipe delimited list of strings, used for radioButtons, future comboBoxes, etc. This is the list of items that are visible to the patient. Setup enforces same number of items in PickListDb for 1:1 match. This list allows customization of what the patient sees vs what's in the db. Example: Vis=Hispanic, Db=2135-2. Example: Vis=Do Not Call, Db=DoNotCall. For radiobuttons, the number of items in the lists determines the number of radiobuttons to show to the patient. These editable lists also allow excluding some db options from being visible to patient. Example: Ins Relationship has 9 options, but only 4 of them are really used in dentistry. Just leave the other 5 off and force them to pick one of the 4. But it is also not required for them to pick one. Example: For Marital Status, you might only show Married and Child, excluding Divorced and Single from the pick list. The unselected state then represents no change, so an existing patient could leave both radio buttons unchecked and their status would remain Divorced or Single. However, we currently lack a feature to let them uncheck a radiobutton that is already checked. This is a rare edge case that nearly nobody will care about. You can also have a row with no db value. For example, a visible value of Separated might have no corresponding db value entered. In that case, an import would not cause any change to the existing db value. These lists also allow two radioButtons to represent one db item. Example: Gender Other in db can be expanded to show patient both Nonbinary and Other. When patient picks either of these, it goes into the db as Other. The lists also allow any or all items to be empty with no label. Example: Y/N radiobuttons for a series of allergies. Y/N label at top, but none of the radiobuttons need labels. When translation is added later, it will translate this list, not the PickListDb. PickListVis will, by default, simply be exactly the same as PickListDb. In this state, what the patient sees is the same as what's in the db. Must have at least two items for now. |
| 9 | PickListDb | varchar(255) |  | Pipe delimited list of strings, used for radioButtons, future comboBoxes, etc. This is the list of items as they would be stored in the database. See PickListVis above for examples of how to use. The value chosen from this list is what will be stored in the ValueString field. Never show this value to the patient. |
| 10 | IsHorizStacking | tinyint(4) |  | Typically false. Set to true to cause this field to get stacked horizontally compared to its previous sibling. Example might be to set State and Zip fields to true. This request will be ignored if screen is too small, like on a phone. The following types are not allowed to stack: SigBox, PageBreak, MedicationList. |
| 11 | IsTextWrap | tinyint(4) |  | Only applies when this is a TextField. Default is false, which creates a single row textbox that scrolls horizontally if text is too long. Set to true to cause text to wrap instead. This will cause the box to grow to fit the text. |
| 12 | Width | int(11) |  | This stores either pixel width or percentage width, depending on IsWidthPercentage. In either case, if this is blank/0, then width will be 100% of what's available. The discussion here is for fixed widths. See IsWidthPercentage for discussion of percentage widths. If fields are stacked horizontally, then they will wrap when they hit screen width. So horizontally stacked fields may end up vertically stacked on a small screen. But if a single field is still set to be wider than the current screen, it will shrink to fit the screen. This width uses WPF DIPs which are 1/96". Android phones define DIPs differently; they use 1/160" per DIP. But if you are using a language like Flutter, they are handling that conversion for you in the background. Regardless, we will be ignoring DIPs and scaling based solely on font size. The reason for this is to make fonts and boxes all look proportionally the same on both OD proper and in eClipboard. So assuming you use 14 flutter logical pixels for 100% font vs 11.5 in WPF, the conversion would look like this: Width/11.5*14. Notice that we are only converting based on font size. This makes our converted width a near perfect fit for the same text as the original. Width is only available on the field types that are h-stackable. |
| 13 | FontScale | int(11) |  | Applies to both the label on the field and the field itself. Never 0. Does not apply to Label types, though, since those are only handled by editing the rich text. Always has a valid value between 50 and 300. Default is 100, indicating normal size. WPF defines a DIP as 1/96". Open Dental uses 11.5 DIPs for nearly all fonts on desktop version. Old Microsoft font sizes were based on 1/72", so 11.5 converts to old 8.6. Android defines a DIP as 1/160". Typical recommended font size on Android seems to be about 16, which translates to 9.6 MS DIPs or 7.2 old Windows font. In other words, recommended phone fonts are physically slightly smaller than desktop fonts. EForms uses font sizes based on 100% being a standard normal size. 100% equates to 11.5 on desktop, probably about 16 on Android phones, and whatever our engineers come up with for tablets. By doing it this way, we do not have to explain anything complicated to users, and they also have very good control over font sizes. |
| 14 | IsRequired | tinyint(4) |  | False by default. If this is set to true, the patient will be required to fill out the field. If conditional logic causes a required field to not show, it will not enforce the requirement. |
| 15 | ConditionalParent | varchar(255) |  | This string is the label of the field that acts as the parent for conditional logic. Empty string by default indicates no parent. Truncated to the first 255 characters. |
| 16 | ConditionalValue | varchar(255) |  |  |
| 17 | LabelAlign | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumEFormLabelAlign 0-TopLeft, 1-LeftLeft, 2-Right. Only used in RadioButtons for now.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• TopLeft (0-Default. Above the radiobuttons, aligned left.)<br>• LeftLeft (1-Left of the remainder of the field, and left aligned within that space.)<br>• Right (2-Right of the remainder of the field, and left aligned within that space.) |
| 18 | SpaceBelow | int(11) |  | The amount of space below each field. Overrides the form and global defaults. -1 indicates to use default. That way, 0 means 0 space. If multiple fields are stacked horizontally, then only the right-most field can have this field set. |
| 19 | ReportableName | varchar(255) |  | Allows reporting on fields that don't have DbLink. |
| 20 | IsLocked | tinyint(4) |  | If a field is locked, it stops a patient from editing the text when presented to them. Example is a consent form. Only available for TextField and CheckBox. This flag inherits from EFormFieldDef and there's no UI to change it once it's in EFormField. In FrmEFormFillEdit, this field has no effect because offices still need to be able to edit. So the field only has an effect when filling out by a patient on the web or in eClipboard. Patients can still use FrmEFormFillEdit, and in that case, it's assumed that office staff is watching to make sure they don't change the text. |
| 21 | Border | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:EnumEFormBorder 0-none, 1-3D. Shaded borders are optional on each field. They are on by default when most fields are added. But they don't make sense in some cases, like labels and stacks of Y/N radio buttons for allergies. When a border is present, any single row textbox inside it gets shown as a single underline instead of a rectangle. If the textbox has text wrapping turned on, it will always be a rectangle.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0-No border)<br>• ThreeD (1-3D border with gradient shadows and rounded corners) |
| 22 | IsWidthPercentage | tinyint(4) |  | False=DIPs / pixels at 96 dpi, True=Percentage. There is no mechanisms for "fill remainder" or "auto size to contents". There is no allowed mixing of fixed and percentage on the same row. Wrap won't happen until all columns have hit their MinWidth. If someone specifies percentages that add up to more than 100, that's ok. We will proportionally adapt. So in addition to expected percentages like 30-30-40, the user would get the same behavior by using 150-150-200. Let's use the example of 150-150-200 and assume MinWidths were 110-100-100. If available width was 400, then the widths would be 120-120-160. If available width was 330, then the widths would be 110-94-126, or (minWidth)-3/7-4/7. Below 310, they would start wrapping. If percentages add up to less than 100, then they might stop short of 100%. For example, 25-25-25 would come up short. They would continue to occupy 75% of available space until the space got so small that they started to hit their MinWidths. Let's assume MinWidths in that example were 50-100-100. If available width was 600, then the widths would be 150-150-150 (still 75%). If available width was 300, then the widths would be 75-100-100 (only 92%). Below 250, they would start wrapping. |
| 23 | MinWidth | int(11) |  | Only used with IsWidthPercentage. If left blank/0, then no minimum width. A number might be present here but will be ignored if IsWidthPercentage is false. |
| 24 | WidthLabel | int(11) |  | If the label is to the left of the field, this is the width of that label. Only used for RadioButtons right now because that's the only type that allows labels to the left. In RadioButtons, this is helpful to allow a stack of radioButtons to line up. Default is 0 to indicate automatic. |
| 25 | SpaceToRight | int(11) |  | The amount of space to the right of each field. Overrides the form and global defaults. -1 indicates to use default. That way, 0 means 0 space. Not used for SigBox or MedicationList which use form level instead. |

## Table: eformfielddef

Individual fields for the EForm. Each field generally includes a label and a value. Links to a EFormDef by FKey to eformdef.EFormDefNum. NOTE: If any new fields get added to this class and EFormField, make sure to add them to the methods EFormFields.FromDef and EFormFields.ToDef

Frequently tied to a database field. Can frequently be prefilled from database if desired. In Sheets, this was two different field types: InputField and OutputField.)<br>• Label (1-This can be used for a label, heading, title, paragraph, etc. These also support the exact same replacement fields as in sheets StaticText. See the extensive comments on the ValueLabel field.)<br>• DateField (2-Some sort of textbox that's optimized for date input.)<br>• CheckBox (3-Simple checkbox that can be tied to a db field.)<br>• RadioButtons (4-Not a single radiobutton, but a group of them.)<br>• SigBox (5-A signature box, directly on the screen with stylus/mouse. Just the drawing, no encryption to tie it to the data yet.)<br>• PageBreak (6-.)<br>• MedicationList (7-A Medication List is a complex field. It consists of a list of medications with an optional second column for strength and frequency. Each medication has a Delete button to its right. There is also an Add button and a None checkbox at the bottom. The None checkbox only shows when the list is empty and allows satisfying a 'required' flag. There is no way to indicate 'no changes', but the office is free to add a separate No Changes checkbox below this list which doesn't actually do anything but which can serve as a visual indicator.) |

## Table: eformimportrule

Each row is a rule that controls how form import logic works. It currently also applies to sheets. Clearly, if there's no row for a specific field, then a global rule handles it. Since there are 4 different situations, we might need 4 global rules just to start. But since users might forget to add them, if any of the 4 is missing, then that situation behaves the old way: action is Review.

| 4 | ClaimNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to claim. FK to claim.ClaimNum if a claim. Otherwise 0. Warning. Original claim might have been deleted. But if Canadian claim was successfully sent, then deletion will be blocked. |
| 5 | OfficeSequenceNumber | int(11) |  | For Canada. Unique for every transaction sent. Increments by one until 999999, then resets to 1. |
| 6 | CarrierTransCounter | int(11) |  | For Canada. Separate counter for each carrier. Increments by one until 99999, then resets to 1. |
| 7 | CarrierTransCounter2 | int(11) |  | For Canada. If this claim includes secondary, then this is the counter for the secondary carrier. |
| 8 | CarrierNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to carrier. FK to carrier.CarrierNum. |
| 9 | CarrierNum2 | bigint(20) |  | FK to carrier. FK to carrier.CarrierNum Only used if secondary insurance info is provided on a claim. Necessary for Canada. |
| 10 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum This is useful in case the original claim has been deleted. Now, we can still tell who the patient was. |
| 11 | BatchNumber | int(11) |  | Maxes out at 999, then loops back to 1. This is not a good key, but is a restriction of (canadian?). So dates must also be used to isolate the correct BatchNumber key. Specific to one clearinghouse. Only used with e-claims. Claim will have BatchNumber, and 997 will have matching BatchNumber. (In X12 lingo, it's a functional group number) |
| 12 | AckCode | varchar(255) |  | A=Accepted, R=Rejected, blank if not able to parse, Recd=Received (835s only). More options will be added later. The incoming 997 or 999 sets this flag automatically. To find the 997 or 999, look for a matching BatchNumber with a similar date, since both the claims and the 997 or 999 will both have the same batch number. The 997 or 999 does not have this flag set on itself. |
| 13 | TransSetNum | int(11) |  | For sent e-claims, within each batch (functional group), each carrier gets it's own transaction set. Since 997s and 999s acknowledge transaction sets rather than batches, we need to keep track of which transaction set each claim is part of as well as which batch it's part of. This field can't be set as part of 997 or 999, because one 997 or 999 refers to multiple trans sets. |
| 14 | Note | text |  | Typical uses include indicating that the report was printed, the claim was resent, reason for rejection, etc. For a 270, this contains the automatically generated short summary of the response. The response could include the reason for failure, or it could be a short summary of the 271. |
| 15 | EtransMessageTextNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to etransmessagetext. FK to etransmessagetext.EtransMessageTextNum. Can be 0 if there is no message text. Multiple Etrans objects can refer to the same message text, very common in a batch. |
| 16 | AckEtransNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to etrans. FK to etrans.EtransNum. Only has a non-zero value if there exists an ack etrans, like a 997, 999, 277ack, 271, 835, or ackError. There can be only one ack for any given etrans, but one ack can apply to multiple etran's that were sent as one batch. 999 FK can be replaced by 277ack FK, and then by 835 FK. This column does triple duty. The AckEtransNum can be used to chain together related etrans entries. For example, if this is a 270 request, then AckEtransNum points to the 271 response. If this is a 271, then AckEtransNum points to the HTML (if any) for the response. |
| 17 | PlanNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to insplan. FK to insplan.PlanNum. Used if EtransType.BenefitInquiry270 and BenefitResponse271 and Eligibility_CA. |
| 18 | InsSubNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to inssub. FK to inssub.InsSubNum. Used if EtransType.BenefitInquiry270 and BenefitResponse271 and Eligibility_CA. |
| 19 | TranSetId835 | varchar(255) |  | X12 ST02 Transaction Set Identifier for an 835. Specifies the unique transaction id within the 835 that this etrans record corresponds to. This column will always be set for 835s imported in version 14.3 or greater. For 835s imported in version 14.2, this column will alway be blank. If blank, and there is more than one transaction id within the 835, then FormEtrans835PickEob will show and allow the user to select the desired EOB from a list. The X12 guide states that there is only one transaction (EOB) allowed per 835, but ClaimConnect returns multiple transactions (EOBs) within a single 835 and other clearinghouses probably do as well. When an 835 is imported, it is examined to determine the number of transactions within it. One etrans entry is created for each EOB within the 835. We may have a similar issue with multiple transactions within 277s as well, but we have not seen any evidence yet. Our current 277 implementation expects a single transaction, just as the X12 standard specifies. |
| 20 | CarrierNameRaw | varchar(60) |  | Only used if the CarrierNum is 0. If CarrierNum is not 0, the name associated to CarrierNum will override CarrierNameRaw in the FormClaimsSend history grid. Added for 835s so that customer databases are not cluttered with dummy carriers and so there is no extra processing time when FormClaimsSend is loading. Size is 60 bytes to match 835 carrier name length. |
| 21 | PatientNameRaw | varchar(133) |  | Only used if the PatNum is 0. If PatNum is not 0, the name associated to PatNum will override PatientNameRaw in the FormClaimsSend history grid. Added for 835s so that there is no extra processing time when FormClaimsSend is loading, and so text representing the patient count can be used instead of an actual patient name. Size is 133 bytes to match X12 specs for last name (60), first name (35), middle name (25), suffix (10), and spaces in between (3). |
| 22 | UserNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to userod. FK to userod.UserNum |

For example, if the average is 3.6 on a 4 point scale, this will show 4. Percentages will be rounded to the nearest whole number. This is the value that will be returned in reports and also used in calculations of the student's grade for the term. |

## Table: evaluationdef

An evaluation def is the entire form that the instructor sets up ahead of time. Actual evaluations for students are copied from these 'templates', so an evaluation def can be altered or deleted without damaging any student record. Evaluation defs are usually not specific to instructors, but if different instructors want different evaluation forms, they can use the description column to differentiate. For example, the description can include the instructor's name or even the year. But most commonly, the same evaluation will be used from year to year. There should be a duplicate function to make a copy an entire evaluation def and then allow user to alter the SchoolCourseNum.

## Table: famaging

This table stores intermediate family aged balances just prior to updating the patient table. Once the aging calculations are finished and the patient table is updated, this table is truncated. At the start of the aging calculations this table is checked and if there are existing rows, we will notify the user and force them to decide whether an aging calculation has already begun or an error happened that prevented the calculations from finishing and the rows are left over and can be deleted.

## Table: guardian

Links patient to patient in a many to many database relationship. The two PatNums need not be in the same family, but will usually be. The two PatNums could be in different families if the relationship was entered, then one of the patients in the relationship is moved to another family. This table can also be used for other relationship types besides guardians. The table name is guardian because we only supported guardian relationships in the past, and we did not want to risk breaking queries by changing the table or column names. User can specify any relationship as a guardian or not a guardian. For example, a retired person might specify their brother or child as their guardian, or the user may want to record the brother of a patient as a non-guardian.

## Table: languagepat

Practice-defined translations for text shown to patients. Unlike Language and LanguageForeign, which translate Open Dental's interface to a practice's preferred language, LanguagePat allows practices to customize translations of messages and information displayed to patients in their preferred language. Used right now for about 30 prefs for things like email messages. Also used for EForms. So either PrefName will be empty or EFormFieldDefNum will be 0. Sheets are translated differently, by making a copy of each SheetFieldDef used for each language.

| 2 | Language | varchar(255) |  | Three-letter language name or custom language name. The custom language name is the full string name and is not necessarily supported by Microsoft. This will typically be matched to the patient's preferred language to select the appropriate translation. Three-letter language name examples: eng (English), spa (Spanish), fra (French).Custom language name examples: Tahitian, American Sign Language, Morse Code. The LanguagesUsedByPatients preference stores the three-letter names that the practice chooses to support. |
| 3 | Translation | text |  | The translated text. Max 65,000 characters. Might store complex email templates. |
| 4 | EFormFieldDefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to eformfielddef. FK to eformfielddef.EFormFieldDefNum. This is how eForms get translated. Once a def is converted to an eForm, this is not needed. The eForm fields have all the translated text. Will be 0 if this is a pref translation. |

## Table: medication

A list of medications, not attached to any particular patient. Not allowed to delete if in use by a patient. Not allowed to edit name once created due to possibility of damage to patient record.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | MedicationNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | MedName | varchar(255) |  | Name of the medication. User can change this. If an RxCui is present, the RxNorm string can be pulled from the in-memory table for UI display in addition to the MedName. |
| 2 | GenericNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to medication. FK to medication.MedicationNum. Cannot be zero. If this is a generic drug, then the GenericNum will be the same as the MedicationNum. Otherwise, if this is a brand drug, then the GenericNum will be a non-zero value corresponding to another medicaiton. |

| 4 | DateTStamp | timestamp |  | The last date and time this row was altered. Not user editable. |
| 5 | RxCui | bigint(20) |  | RxNorm Code identifier. We should have used a string type. Used by EHR in CQM. But the queries should use medicationpat.RxCui, NOT this RxCui, because all medicationpats (meds and orders) coming back from NewCrop will not have a FK to this medication table. When this RxCui is modified by the user, then medicationpat.RxCui is automatically updated where medicationpat.MedicationNum matches this medication. |

## Table: medicationpat

Links medications to patients. For ehr, some of these can be considered 'medication orders', but only if they contain a PatNote (instructions), a ProvNum, and a DateStart.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | MedicationPatNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. |
| 2 | MedicationNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to medication. FK to medication.MedicationNum. If 0, implies that the medication order came from eRx. This was done to allow MU2 measures to be set by either creating a medication from the medical window, or by creating an manual prescription. |
| 3 | PatNote | text |  | Medication notes specific to this patient. Example: 10 mg tablets, two tabs 3 times per day |
| 4 | DateTStamp | timestamp |  | The last date and time this row was altered. Not user editable. |
| 5 | DateStart | date |  | Date that the medication was started. Can be minval if unknown. |
| 6 | DateStop | date |  | Date that the medication was stopped. Can be minval if unknown. If minval, then the medication is not "discontinued". If prior to today, then the medication is "discontinued". If today or a future date, then not discontinued yet. |
| 7 | ProvNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to provider. FK to provider.ProvNum. Can be 0. Gets set to the patient's primary provider when adding a new med. If adding the med from EHR, gets set to the ProvNum of the logged-in user. |
| 8 | MedDescript | varchar(255) |  | Used for eRx and eForm import. In these cases, MedicationNum=0. |
| 9 | RxCui | bigint(20) |  | For NewCrop medical orders, corresponds to the RxCui of the prescription (NewCrop only returns a value sometimes). Otherwise, this field is synched with the medication.RxCui field based on medication.MedicationNum. We should have used a string type. The only purpose of this field is so that when CCDs are created, we have structured data to put in the XML, not just plain text. Allergies exported in CCD do not look at this table, but only at the medication table. Medications require MedicationPat.RxCui or Medication.RxCui to be exported on CCD. |
| 10 | ErxGuid | varchar(255) |  | Uniquely identifies the prescription corresponding to the medical order. Allows us to update existing eRx medical orders when refreshing prescriptions in the Chart (similar to how prescriptions are updated). Also used in 2-way medication synching with eRx. |
| 11 | IsCpoe | tinyint(4) |  | If eRx is used to prescribe a medication, a medication order is imported automatically into Open Dental. If a provider is logged in, then this is CPOE (Computerized Provider Order Entry), and this will be true. Or, if a provider is logged in and Rx entered through OD, it's also CPOE. If a staff person is logged in, and enters an Rx through NewCrop or OD, then this is non-CPOE, so false. |

## Table: mount

A mount shows in the images module just like other images in the tree. But it is just a container for images within it rather than an actual image itself. A mount layout cannot be edited once created for a patient (simply because we didn't add that functionality), but the individual images on it can be edited.

## Table: payortype

Used to identify the source of payment for a given patient at a given point in time. As insurance is added and removed, rows should be either automatically inserted into this table, or the user should be prompted to specify what the new payor type is. The DateStart of one payor type is interpreted as the end date of the previous payor type. Example: Patient with no insurance may have payortype.SopCode=81 ("SelfPay"). Patient then adds Medicaid insurance and gets a second new PayorType entry with SopCode=2 (Medicaid).

## Table: payplancharge

One of the dated charges attached to a payment plan. This has nothing to do with payments, but rather just causes the amount due to increase on the date of the charge. The amount of the charge is the sum of the principal and the interest.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|

| 2 | Guarantor | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. The guarantor account that each charge will affect. Does not have to match the guarantor of the payment plan. This column doesn't even have to point to a guarantor at all. E.g. Credits and Closeout debits will be linked to the patient, not guarantor. |
| 3 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. The patient account that the principal gets removed from. |
| 4 | ChargeDate | date |  | The date that the charge will show on the patient account. Any charge with a future date will not show on the account yet and will not affect the balance. |
| 5 | Principal | double |  | For Debits, this is the principal charge amount. For Credits (version 2 only), then this is the credit amount. |
| 6 | Interest | double |  | For Debits, this is the interest portion of this payment. Always 0 for Credits. |
| 7 | Note | text |  | Any note about this particular payment plan charge |
| 8 | ProvNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to provider. FK to provider.ProvNum. Since there is no ProvNum field at the payplan level, the provider must be the same for all payplancharges. It's initially assigned as the patient priProv. Payments applied should be to this provnum, although the current user interface does not help with this. |
| 9 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. Since there is no ClincNum field at the payplan level, the clinic must be the same for all payplancharges. It's initially assigned using the patient clinic. Payments applied should be to this clinic, although the current user interface does not help with this. |
| 10 | ChargeType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:PayPlanChargeType The charge type of the payment plan. 0 - ChargeDue, 1 - Production.

| 15 | FKey | bigint(20) |  | Only present for dynamic payment plans. Contains FKey of the link type. ProcNum, AdjNum, or OrthoCaseNum. Since one ChargeDue can be split to multiple procedures, multiple rows are created in that case. In UI, these would be grouped by due date unless user checked ungroup box. |
| 16 | LinkType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:PayPlanLinkType Only present for dynamic payment plans.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (0 - None. Should only be this when charges/credits are for regular static payment plans. )<br>• Adjustment (1 - Adjustment )<br>• Procedure (2 - Procedure )<br>• OrthoCase (3 - OrthoCase ) |
| 17 | IsOffset | tinyint(4) |  | Set to true if this charge is created to offset an overcharge |

| 4 | ProcDate | date |  | Procedure date that will show in the account as the date performed. If just treatment planned, the date can be the date it was tp'd, or the date can be min val if we don't care. Also see ProcTime column. |
| 5 | ProcFee | double |  | Procedure fee. |
| 6 | Surf | varchar(10) |  | Surfaces, or use "UL" etc for quadrant, "2" etc for sextant, "U","L" for arches.

In Canada, Sextants are 03 through 08 (add 2 to the US sextant and prepend a zero). |
| 7 | ToothNum | varchar(2) |  | May be blank, otherwise 1-32 or A-T, 1 or 2 char. For supernumerary, add 50 to use 51-82. For supernumerary primary, use AS-TS. For Canadian users, using FDI nomenclature, we use 51 as a placeholder for supernumerary teeth, which is tooth number 99 according to CDHA standards (2/17/2014). Logic for this is handled in the tooth logic class. |

| 18 | DateEntryC | date |  | This is the date this procedure was entered or set complete. If not status C, then the value is ignored. This date is set automatically when Insert, but older data or converted data might not have this value set. It gets updated when set complete. User never allowed to edit. This will be enhanced later. |
| 19 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. 0 if no clinic. |

| 23 | ProcNumLab | bigint(20) |  | FK to procedurelog. FK to procedurelog.ProcNum. Only used in Canada. If not zero, then this proc is a lab fee and this indicates to which actual procedure the lab fee is attached. For ordinary use, they are treated like two separate procedures. It's only for insurance claims that we need to know which lab fee belongs to which procedure. Two lab fees may be attached to one procedure. |
| 24 | BillingTypeOne | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum. Lets some users track charges for certain types of reports. For example, a Medicaid billing type could be assigned to a procedure, flagging it for inclusion in a report mandated by goverment.

| 33 | BaseUnits | int(11) |  | Base units used for some billing codes. Default is 0. No UI for this field. It is only edited in the ProcedureCode window. The database maint tool changes BaseUnits of all procedures to match that of the procCode. Not sure yet what it's for. |
| 34 | StartTime | int(11) |  | Start time in military. Doesn't seem to affect sorting in the ProgressNotes, although we could do that some day. |
| 35 | StopTime | int(11) |  | Stop time in military. No longer used, but not deleting just in case someone has critical information stored here. |
| 36 | DateTP | date |  | The date that the procedure was originally treatment planned. Does not change when marked complete. |
| 37 | SiteNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to site. FK to site.SiteNum. |

One or more of the following: A=Repair of a prior service, B=Temporary placement, C=TMJ, E=Implant, L=Appliance lost, S=Appliance stolen, X=none of the above. Blank is equivalent to X for claim output, but one value will not be automatically converted to the other in this table. That will allow us to track user entry for procedurecode.IsProsth. |
| 40 | ProcTime | time |  | Used to be part of the ProcDate, but that was causing reporting issues. |
| 41 | ProcTimeEnd | time |  | Marks the time a procedure was finished. |
| 42 | DateTStamp | timestamp |  | Automatically updated by MySQL every time a row is added or changed. |
| 43 | Prognosis | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum, which contains text of the Prognosis. |

This is the default for both medical and inst when creating X12 claims, regardless of what is set on the proc.)<br>• Days (3-Only allowed on institutional SV204.) |
| 47 | StatementNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to statement. FK to statement.StatementNum. Only used when the statement in an invoice. |
| 48 | IsLocked | tinyint(4) |  | If this flag is set, then the proc is locked down tight. No changes at all can be made except to append, sign, or invalidate. Invalidate really just sets the proc to status 'deleted'. An invalidated proc retains its IsLocked status. All locked procs will be status of C or D. Locked group notes will be status of EC or D. |

| 56 | Discount | double |  | Stores the dollar amount of the discount, not full price. E.g. for a 10% discount, Fee = $160 Discount = $16. This column is used by treatment planned procedures to create an adjustment when set complete. It should not be used as an accurate monetary discount value for completed procedures. |
| 57 | IsDateProsthEst | tinyint(4) |  | For prosthesis replacement procedures on 5010 eclaims only. If true, indicates that the DateOriginalProsth is an estimated date. Estimated dates are often used when the original prosthesis was performed by another doctor. |
| 58 | IcdVersion | tinyint |  | The ICD code version for all diagnosis codes on this procedure, including DiagnosisCode, DiagnosisCode2, DiagnosisCode3, and DiagnosisCode4. Value of 9 for ICD-9, 10 for ICD-10, etc. Default value is 9. This value is copied from the DxIcdVersion preference when a procedure is created. The user can also manually change the IcdVersion on individual procedures. |
| 59 | IsCpoe | tinyint(4) |  | Procedures will be flagged as CPOE (Computerized Provider Order Entry) if this procedure was created by a provider. If a provider views, edits, or has any interaction with this procedure after its creation, it will be flagged as IsCPOE. Also, there will be a helpful window where providers can go to to "approve" non-CPOE procedures and mark them as CPOE to help meet EHR measures. If a staff person is logged in and enters this procedure then this is non-CPOE, so false. |
| 60 | SecUserNumEntry | bigint(20) |  | FK to userod. FK to userod.UserNum. Set to the user logged in when the row was inserted at SecDateEntry date and time. |
| 61 | SecDateEntry | datetime |  | Timestamp automatically generated and user not allowed to change. The actual date and time of entry. |
| 62 | DateComplete | date |  | The date the procedure was originally set complete. If status is set complete and then set to something other than complete, this field will be set to DateTime.MinValue if DateComplete is today. If DateComplete is set to a day in the past and the status is changed from complete to something else, the field will not be cleared or updated. Db only field used by one customer and this is how they requested it. PatNum #19191 |
| 63 | OrderingReferralNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to referral. FK to referral.ReferralNum. Goes hand-in-hand with ProvOrderOverride. Medical eclaims only. Defaults to zero. If set, and the ProvOrderOverride is not set, then this referral will go out at the ordering provider on medical e-claims. |
| 64 | TaxAmt | double |  | Holds the Sales Tax estimate for this procedure. Becomes a finalized amount when the procedure is marked complete. |
| 65 | Urgency | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:ProcUrgency Used in 1500 Medical Claim Form box 24c. Normal=blank 24c,Emergency='Y' in 24c.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• Normal (0 - Standard procedure urgency.  Most procedures will have this ProcUrgency.  This will result in the 1500 Medical Claim Form box 24c
            being blank.  (Normal=blank,Emergency='Y'))<br>• Emergency (1 - Emergency ProcUrgency is used to populate the 1500 Medical Claim Form box 24c with a 'Y'. (Emergency='Y',Normal=blank)) |
| 66 | DiscountPlanAmt | double |  | The difference between the UCR fee and discount plan fee. Frequently recalculated when procedure is TP. |

## Table: procnote

A procedure note for one procedure. User does not have any direct control over this table at all. It's handled automatically. When user "edits" a procedure note, the program actually just adds another note. No note can EVER be edited or deleted.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | ProcNoteNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum |
| 2 | ProcNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to procedurelog. FK to procedurelog.ProcNum |
| 3 | EntryDateTime | datetime |  | The server time that this note was entered. Essentially a timestamp. |
| 4 | UserNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to userod. FK to userod.UserNum. |
| 5 | Note | text |  | The actual note. |
| 6 | SigIsTopaz | tinyint |  | There are two kinds of signatures. Topaz signatures use hardware manufactured by that company, and the signature is created by their library. OD signatures work exactly the same way, but are only for on-screen signing. |
| 7 | Signature | text |  | The encrypted signature. A signature starts as a collection of vectors. The Topaz .sig file format is proprietary. The OD signature format looks like this: 45,68;48,70;49,72;0,0;55,88;etc. It's simply a sequence of points, separated by semicolons. 0,0 represents pen up. Then, a hash is created from the Note, concatenated directly with the userNum. For example, "This is a note3" gets turned into a hash of 2849283940385391 (16 bytes). The hash is used to encrypt the signature data string using symmetric encryption. Therefore, the actual signature cannot be retrieved from the database by ordinary means. Also, the signature info cannot even be retrieved by Open Dental at all unless it supplies the same hash as before, proving that the data has not changed since signed. If OD supplies the correct hash, then it will be able to extract the sequence of vectors which it will then use to display the signature. The OD sigs are not compressed, and the Topaz sigs are. But there is very little difference in their sizes. It would be very rare for a signature to be larger than 1000 bytes. |

## Table: programproperty

Some program links (bridges), have properties that need to be set. The property names are always hard coded. User can change the value. The property is usually retrieved based on its name.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | ProgramPropertyNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | ProgramNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to program. FK to program.ProgramNum |
| 2 | PropertyDesc | varchar(255) |  | The description or prompt for this property. Blank for workstation overrides of program path. Many bridges use this description as an "internal description". This way it can act like a FK in order to look up this particular property. Users cannot edit. |
| 3 | PropertyValue | text |  | The value. Could contain FK to other tables. |
| 4 | ComputerName | varchar(255) |  | The human-readable name of the computer on the network (not the IP address). Only used when overriding program path. Blank for typical Program Properties. |
| 5 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. This is only used by a few bridges. Set to 0 for most bridges. |
| 6 | IsMasked | tinyint(4) |  | Is true if the program property is sensitive information that would need to be masked in the UI. False by default. |
| 7 | IsHighSecurity | tinyint(4) |  | Is true if the program property is a high security property. False by default. |

## Table: reactivation

Track patient contact via a commlog type ("Reactivation"). Any commlogs of this type that occur after the last completed procedure will be considered a contact attempt. Patients should show in this list if they have previously completed procedures (excluding broken/canceled), and the most recent was completed before the time span specified by the "Days Past" preference. Include Patients with the following PatStatus: Patient, Inactive, Prospective Patients should not show in this list if they have been marked "Do not contact". Patients should not show in this list if a future appointment is scheduled. Once contacted, Patient should not show in this list. Patient will later reappear in this list if the "Reactivation contact interval" time period passes since the last contact and an appointment has not yet been scheduled. If the patient is contacted the maximum number of times specified by the "Count Contact Max" preference, mark the patient as "Do Not Contact". Example: Johnny Patient had his last procedure completed on 1/1/2018. There is a "Reactivation" type commlog on his chart from 6/1/2018. He does not have any future scheduled appointments. Johnny would be included in the list of "Reactivation" patients, with a single contact attempt having been made already.

## Table: recall

A patient can only have one recall object per type. The recall table stores a few dates that must be kept synchronized with other information in the database. This is difficult. Anytime one of the following items changes, things need to be synchronized: procedurecode.SetRecall, any procedurelog change for a patient (procs added, deleted, completed, status changed, date changed, etc), patient status changed. There are expected to be a few bugs in the synchronization logic, so anytime a patient's recall is opened, it will also update. During synchronization, the program will frequently alter DateDueCalc, DateDue, and DatePrevious based on trigger procs. The system will also add and delete recalls as necessary. But it will not delete a recall unless all values are default and there is no useful information. When a user tries to delete a recall, they will only be successful if the trigger conditions do not apply. Otherwise, they will have to disable the recall instead.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | RecallNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum. |
| 2 | DateDueCalc | date |  | Not editable. The calculated date due. Generated by the program and subject to change anytime the conditions change. It can be blank (0001-01-01) if no appropriate triggers. |
| 3 | DateDue | date |  | This is the date that is actually used when doing reports for recall. It will usually be the same as DateDueCalc unless user has changed it. System will only update this field if it is the same as DateDueCalc. Otherwise, it will be left alone. Gets cleared along with DateDueCalc when resetting recall. When setting disabled, this field will also be cleared. This is the field to use if converting from another software. |
| 4 | DatePrevious | date |  | Not editable. Previous date that procedures were done to trigger this recall. It is calculated and enforced automatically. If you want to affect this date, add a procedure to the chart with a status of C, EC, or EO. |
| 5 | RecallInterval | int(11) |  | The interval between recalls. The Interval struct combines years, months, weeks, and days into a single integer value. |
| 6 | RecallStatus | bigint(20) |  | FK to definition. FK to definition.DefNum, or 0 for none. |
| 7 | Note | text |  | An administrative note for staff use. |
| 8 | IsDisabled | tinyint |  | If true, this recall type will be disabled (there's only one type right now). This is usually used rather than deleting the recall type from the patient because trigger conditions must be enforced for all patients. |

| 10 | RecallTypeNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to recalltype. FK to recalltype.RecallTypeNum. |
| 11 | DisableUntilBalance | double |  | Default is 0. If a positive number is entered, then the family balance must be less in order for this recall to show in the recall list. |
| 12 | DisableUntilDate | date |  | If a date is entered, then this recall will be disabled until that date. |
| 13 | DateScheduled | date |  | This will only have a value if a recall is scheduled. |

The original purpose of this column was to use it in connection with RefID of the Sheet and SheetDef to automate the updating of forms such as office policies when they change significantly. It is now also used when making a copy of a sheet. Also used alongside EClipboardSheetDef to determine whether patient has already filled out a form. |

| 0 | SheetFieldNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | SheetNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to sheet. FK to sheet.SheetNum. |
| 2 | FieldType | int(11) |  | Enum:SheetFieldType OutputText, InputField, StaticText,Parameter(only used for SheetField, not SheetFieldDef),Image,Drawing,Line,Rectangle,CheckBox,SigBox,PatImage.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• OutputText (0-Pulled from the database to be printed on the sheet.  Or also possibly just generated at runtime even though not pulled from the database.   User still allowed to change the output text as they are filling out the sheet so that it can different from what was initially generated.)<br>• InputField (1-A blank box that the user is supposed to fill in.)<br>• StaticText (2-This is text that is defined as part of the sheet and will never change from sheet to sheet.  )<br>• Parameter (3-Stores a parameter other than the PatNum.  Not meant to be seen on the sheet.  Only used for SheetField, not SheetFieldDef.)<br>• Image (4-Any image of any size, typically a background image for a form.)<br>• Drawing (5-One sequence of dots that makes a line.  Continuous without any breaks.  Each time the pen is picked up, it creates a new field row in the database.)<br>• Line (6-A simple line drawn from x,y to x+width,y+height.  So for these types, we must allow width and height to be negative or zero.)<br>• Rectangle (7-A simple rectangle outline.)<br>• CheckBox (8-A clickable area on the screen.  It's a form of input, so treated similarly to an InputField.  The X will go from corner to corner of the rectangle specified.  It can also behave like a radio button)<br>• SigBox (9-A signature box, either Topaz pad or directly on the screen with stylus/mouse.  The signature is encrypted based an a hash of all
            other field values in the entire sheet, excluding other SigBoxes.  The order is critical.)<br>• PatImage (10-An image specific to one patient.)<br>• Special (11-Special: Used for ToothChart, ToothChartLegend, and 3 more chart module items.)<br>• Grid (12-Grid: Placeable grids similar to ODGrids. Used primarily in statements.)<br>• ComboBox (13-ComboBox: Placeable combo box for selecting filled options.)<br>• ScreenChart (14-ScreenChart: A tooth chart that is desiged for screenings.)<br>• MobileHeader (15-MobileHeader: The parent field of a group of fields. All fields in between this field and the next MobileHeader will be grouped toghether in the mobile view.
            EG... "Personal", "Address and Home Phone", "Insurance".)<br>• SigBoxPractice (16-A signature box, either Topaz pad or directly on the screen with stylus/mouse.  The signature is encrypted based an a hash of all 
            other field values in the entire sheet, excluding other SigBoxes.  The order is critical.) |
| 3 | FieldName | varchar(255) |  | Mostly for OutputText and InputField types. Each sheet typically has a main datatable type.OutputText: FieldName is usually the string representation of the database column for the main table. For other tables, it can be of the form table.Column. There may also be extra fields available that are not strictly pulled from the database. Extra fields will start with lowercase to indicate that they are not pure database fields. The list of available fields for each type in SheetFieldsAvailable. Users can pick from that list. InputField: are internally tied to actions to persist the data. So they are also hard coded and are available in SheetFieldsAvailable. Static images: this is the full file name including extension, but without path. Static images paths are reconstructed by looking in the AtoZ folder, SheetImages folder. PatImage: Either the DefNum for the default document category or "Patient Info.gif" to indicate our baked-in patient info form. DefNum is used in SheetFiller to find a document num, this is translated in FormSheetFillEdit to a human readable name. Example: 113 (if 113 is the defnum for photos). In FormSheetFillEdit, this will display as PatImg:photos.Parameter: the FieldName stores the name of the parameter. |
| 4 | FieldValue | text |  | For OutputText, this value is set before printing. This is the data obtained from the database and ready to print. For StaticText, this is copied from the sheetFieldDef, but in-line fields like [this] will have been filled. For an archived sheet retrieved from the database (all SheetField rows), this value will have been saved and will not be filled again automatically.For InputField, this is the filled value. If an an AutoNote attached, then this field will start out like AutoNoteNum:### until they click to fill out the autonote.Parameter fieldtype: this will store the value of the parameter. FKs are numbers. Two of the parameters allow multiple ProcNums, which are stored here as comma list.Drawing fieldtype: this will be the point data for the lines. The format would look similar to this: 45,68;48,70;49,72;0,0;55,88;etc. It's simply a sequence of points, separated by semicolons.CheckBox: it will either be an X or empty.SigBox: the first char will be 0 or 1 to indicate SigIsTopaz, and all subsequent chars will be the Signature itself.PatImage: FK to document.DocNum, or blank, or "MountNum:####" to indicate mount instead of document.ComboBox: The chosen option, semicolon, then a pipe delimited list of options such as: March;January|February|March|AprilScreenChart: Contains a semicolon delimited list of a single number followed by groups of comma separated surfaces. The first digit represents what type of ScreenChart it is. 0 = Permanent, 1 = Primary It may look like 0;S,P,N;S,S,S;... etc. |

| 11 | Height | int(11) |  | The field will be constrained vertically to this size. Not allowed to be stored as 0. It's not allowed to be zero so that it will be visible on the designer. Set to 0 in memory by SheetUtil.CalculateHeights if image is innacessible for printing. |
| 12 | GrowthBehavior | int(11) |  | Enum:GrowthBehaviorEnum<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (Not allowed to grow.  Max size would be Height and Width.)<br>• DownLocal (Can grow down if needed, and will push nearby objects out of the way so that there is no overlap.)<br>• DownGlobal (Can grow down, and will push down all objects on the sheet that are below it.  Mostly used when drawing grids.)<br>• FillRightDown (Used with dynamic grids to grow the grid to fill to the right and bottom of the parent control, does not check for overlap.)<br>• FillDown (Used with dynamic grids to grow the grid to fill to the bottom of the parent control, does not check for overlap.)<br>• FillRight (Used with dynamic grids to grow the grid to fill to the right of the parent control, does not check for overlap.)<br>• FillDownFitColumns (Used with dynamic grids to grow the grid to fill vertical space in parent control and fit grid width to include all columns.
            Primarily for ProgressNotes grid in Chart Module.) |
| 13 | RadioButtonValue | varchar(255) |  | This is only used for checkboxes that you want to behave like radiobuttons. Set the FieldName the same for each Checkbox in the group. The FieldValue will likely be X for one of them and empty string for the others. Each of them will have a different RadioButtonValue. Whichever box has X, the RadioButtonValue for that box will be used when importing. This field is not used for "misc" radiobutton groups. |
| 14 | RadioButtonGroup | varchar(255) |  | Name which identifies the group within which the radio button belongs. FieldName must be set to "misc" in order for the group to take effect. |

| 18 | TextAlign | tinyint(4) |  | Text Alignment for text fields. |
| 19 | ItemColor | int(11) |  | Text color, line color, rectangle color. -16777216 is Black. 0 means Empty, which we attempt to treat as black if it happens. |
| 20 | DateTimeSig | datetime |  | DateTime that a sheet was signed. |
| 21 | IsLocked | tinyint(4) |  | If a sheet field is locked, it stops a user from editing the text when presented in a sheet. |
| 22 | TabOrderMobile | int(11) |  | Tab stop order for all fields of a mobile sheet. One-based. Only mobile fields can have values other than 0. If all SheetFieldDefs for a given SheetField are 0 then assume that this sheet has no mobile-specific view. |
| 23 | UiLabelMobile | text |  | Each input field for a mobile will need a corresponding UI label. This is what the user sees as the label describing what this input is for. EG "First Name:, Last Name:, Address, etc." For check boxes, this field should be blank otherwise a group box will be displayed to the user with this text. For radio buttons, this field should be set to the text of the group caption. |
| 24 | UiLabelMobileRadioButton | text |  | Human readable label that will be displayed for radio button item in mobile mode. Cannot use UiLabelMobile for this purpose as it is already dedicated to the radio group header that groups radio button items together. |
| 25 | SheetFieldDefNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to sheetfielddef. FK to sheetfielddef.SheetFieldDefNum. Only used in the Patient Forms window when the Prefill button is clicked. |
| 26 | CanElectronicallySign | tinyint(4) |  | When true, allows a user to sign a signature box electronically. |
| 27 | IsSigProvRestricted | tinyint(4) |  | When true, only allows the signature box to be signed by a provider. |

| 3 | FieldName | varchar(255) |  | FieldName is used differently for different FieldTypes. For OutputText, each sheet typically has a main datatable type. For example statements correspond to the statment table. See SheetFieldsAvailable.GetList() for available values. If the output field exactly matches a column from the main table this will be the <ColumnName>. For example, "FName" on patient Forms. If the output field exactly matches a column from a different table this will be the <tablename>.<ColumnName>. For example, appt.Note on Routing Slips. If the output field is not a database column it must start with a lowercase letter. For example, "statementReceiptInvoice" on Statements.For InputField, these are hardcoded to correspond to DB fields, for example "FName" corresponsds to patient.FName. See SheetFieldsAvailable.GetList() for available values.For Image, this file name with extention, for example "image1.jpg". Some image names are handled specially, for example "Patient Info.gif". Images are stored in <imagefolder>\SheetImages\image1.jpg.For CheckBox, this groups checkboxes together so that only one per group can be checked.For PatImage, this is the name of the DocCategory.For Special, identifies the type of special field. Currently only ToothChart and ToothChartLegend.For Grid, this is the specific type of grid. See SheetUtil.GetDataTableForGridType() for values. For example "StatementPayPlan".For all other fieldtypes, FieldName is blank or irrelevant. |
| 4 | FieldValue | text |  | For StaticText, this text can include bracketed fields, like [nameLF]. For OutputText and InputField, this will be blank. If an InputField has an AutoNote attached, then this field will be AutoNoteNum:'value'. Example AutoNoteNum:268.For CheckBoxes, either X or blank. Even if the checkbox is set to behave like a radio button. For Pat Images, this is blank. The filename of a PatImage will later be stored in SheetField.FieldValue.For ComboBoxes, the chosen option, semicolon, then a pipe delimited list of options such as: March;January|February|March|AprilFor ScreenCharts, a semicolon delimited list of comma separated surfaces.

Could also be a name manually entered by the user if there's already a connection to the app server from the same computer session. This serves as a human-readable name for the ComputerName+SessionId+ProcessId to uniquely identify a kiosk. We will display the ComputerName and SessionName to the user in the kiosk manager, but we will use the ComputerName+SessionId+ProcessId when the kiosk checks for available forms to display. |

## Table: tsitranslog

Transworld Systems Inc (TSI) transaction log. Logs communication between the Open Dental program and TSI. Entries contain information about accounts placed with TSI, payments or adjustments to accounts placed, or transactions to Suspend, Reinstate or Cancel accounts.

| Order | Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | TsiTransLogNum | bigint(20) |  | Primary key. |
| 1 | PatNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to patient. FK to patient.PatNum for the guarantor of the account sent to TSI for collection services. TSI refers to this as the Debtor Reference or Responsible Party Account Number. |
| 2 | UserNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to userod. FK to userod.UserNum. The user who sent the account for placement with TSI or who suspended, reinstated or cancelled collection services for an account placed with TSI or who created the payment/adjustment for an account placed with TSI. |
| 3 | TransType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:TsiTransType - Identifies the transaction message sent to TSI. Can be a message for placing/cancelling/suspending/reinstating collection services for an account or to notify TSI of a payment/writeoff/adjustment entered into OD.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (-1 - None: Used for marking trans that represent account items NOT sent to Transworld.  The TsiTransLogs with this trans type are used
            to prevent the ODService from sending the trans to Transworld.  Example: Transworld collects a payment from a patient and deduct their fee and
            send the practice the remaining amt.  Office staff will enter the payment in the patient's account and then enter an adjustment to account for
            Transworld's fee.  TsiTransLogs will be inserted for the paysplits and adjustment so that we don't send those trans to Transworld and cause an
            infinite loop of sorts.  Logs with this type will be update by the ODService if the ledger trans amt is updated.)<br>• CN (0 - Cancel: cancel collection services for an account. Collection services can be restarted but will incur another TSI fee.)<br>• CR (1 - Credit Adjustment: negative adjustment to reduce balance. Example: a discount given or portion of the debt written off.)<br>• DB (2 - Debit Adjustment: positive adjustment to increase balance.  Offices are supposed to stop all finance charges once placed with TSI,
            but there may be other transactions that require increasing the amount owed.)<br>• PF (3 - Paid in Full: payment entered that pays off account balance.  Closes account with TSI and stops collection activity.)<br>• PL (4 - Placement: account sent to TSI for Accelerator/Profit Recovery/Collection services.)<br>• PP (5 - Partial Payment: payment by either patient or ins payment/writeoff that pays a portion of the balance.)<br>• PT (6 - Paid in Full, Thank You: payment entered that pays off account balance.  Closes account with TSI and stops collection activity.
            TSI will send a Thank You letter to the patient free of charge.)<br>• RI (7 - Reinstate: an account that has been suspended can be reinstated within 50 days and the collection services will resume where it
            left off.  After 50 days the account is automatically cancelled and in order to restart collection services the office would have to initiate a
            new placement, which will incur another TSI fee.)<br>• SS (8 - Suspend: places collection services for the account on hold for up to 50 days.  Example: After an account is placed with TSI, the
            customer comes into the office and agrees to a payment plan.  The account can be suspended and if the patient fails to make a payment within 50
            days the account can be reinstated and the collection process will resume where it left off and TSI will not charge an additional fee.  After
            50 days the account is automatically cancelled by TSI and in order to restart the collection process, the office would have to initiate a new
            placement which starts the collection process over and will result in an additional TSI fee.)<br>• Agg (9 - To differentiate aggregate rows from rows linked to transactions in the OD db.)<br>• Excluded (10 - Used for adjustments entered with the SyncExcludePosAdjType or SyncExcludeNegAdjType set in the Transworld program link.
            Excluded from syncing with TSI and from the amount due calculation used in future msgs or to determine if the acct is paid in full.) |
| 4 | TransDateTime | datetime |  | Timestamp at which this row was created. Auto generated on insert. Identifies exactly when the action happened in OD to cause the message to be sent to TSI. |
| 5 | ServiceType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:TsiServiceType - for placements, this is the type of collection activity that will start on the account being placed.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• Accelerator (0 - Accelerator)<br>• ProfitRecovery (1 - Profit Recovery)<br>• ProfessionalCollections (2 - Professional Collections) |
| 6 | ServiceCode | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:TsiServiceCode - for placements, intensity of first letter sent to guarantor. Will usually be 0 - Diplomatic.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• Diplomatic (0 - Diplomatic: most commonly used service code.)<br>• Intensive (1 - Intensive:  More intense first letter.)<br>• BadCheck (3 - Bad Check: in a conference call with TSI one of the reps said this is rarely used.) |
| 7 | TransAmt | double |  | Used for payments/writeoffs/adjustments, amount applied to the debt. |
| 8 | AccountBalance | double |  | Total balance due on the account by the patient, i.e. BalTotal-InsPayEst-WoEst. If this is a placement, this is the debt amount TSI is going to attempt to collect. If this is a payment/writeoff/adjustment, this is the new balance after the transaction amount is applied to the debt. |
| 9 | FKeyType | tinyint(4) |  | Enum:TsiFKeyType - Used in conjunction with FKey to point to the item that this log row represents.<br><br>**Enum values:**<br>• None (-1 - None.  For place, suspend, cancel, agg.)<br>• Adjustment (0 - adjustment.AdjNum.  Can be a positive (Debit) or negative (Credit) adjustment to the amount owed.  The resulting message
            TsiTransType is DB (Debit) for positive adjustments or CR (Credit) for negative adjustments.)<br>• Claimproc (1 - claimproc.ClaimProcNum. For ins payments and/or writeoffs entered after the account has been placed with TSI.  The resulting
            message TsiTransType is PP (Partial Payment), PF (Paid in Full), or PT (Paid in Full, Thank You).)<br>• PayPlan (2 - payplan.PayPlanNum.  In payplan version 1 the entire CompletedAmt is aged, so it will be negative (credit) and decrease the amount
            owed.  The resulting message TsiTransType is CR (Credit).)<br>• PayPlanCharge (3 - payplancharge.PayPlanChargeNum.  Depends on payplan version, could be negative (credit - decrease amount owed) or
            positive (debit - increase amount owed).  The resulting message TsiTransType is DB (Debit) if positive or CR (Credit) if negative.)<br>• PaySplit (4 - paysplit.SplitNum.  Patient payment on an account placed with TSI.  The resulting message TsiTransType is PP (Partial Payment),
            PF (Paid in Full), or PT (Paid in Full, Thank You).)<br>• Procedure (5 - procedurelog.ProcNum.  Positive (debit, increases the amount owed).  The resulting message TsiTransType is DB (Debit).) |
| 10 | FKey | bigint(20) |  | Foreign key to the table defined by the corresponding FKeyType. Currently supports paysplit.SplitNum, claimproc.ClaimProcNum, adjustment.AdjNum, procedurelog.ProcNum, payplan.PayPlanNum, payplancharge.PayPlanChargeNum. |
| 11 | RawMsgText | varchar(1000) |  | Raw pipe-delimited message sent to TSI. |
| 12 | ClientId | varchar(25) |  | If ServiceType for the placement is TsiDemandType.AcceleratorPr, this will be the Accelerator/Profit Recovery client ID. If TsiServiceType.Collection it will be the Collection client ID. Will always match the first field, Client Number, in the RawMsgText. |
| 13 | TransJson | mediumtext |  | Json serialized string representation of the TsiTrans list used to calculate the account balance for this guarantor at the time of placement with Transworld. Used to update Transworld if any of the transactions are modified after placement. |
| 14 | ClinicNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to clinic. FK to clinic.ClinicNum. This will be 0 if clinics are not enabled. This will be 0 for logs prior to version 18.4. |
| 15 | AggTransLogNum | bigint(20) |  | FK to tsitranslog. FK to tsitranslog.TransLogNum. Will be 0 if not part of an aggregate group. Will be 0 for logs prior to version 18.4. |

## Table: xwebresponse

Received as XML output from XWeb gateway. Not all fields are available for all method calls. This is a combination of all possible output fields. The fields that are available are dependent on which method was called and the given result. HPF (XWeb Hosted Payment Form) Payments and HPF CC Alias creations will each enter a row in this table. That row will be monitored by the eConnector and updated when the XWebResponseCode changes from Pending. -- 1) Create the row and indicate the HPF/OTK. -- 2) Poll the OTK (one-time key) until an XWebResponseCode is available. Update the row with information about the transaction. DTG (XWeb Direct To Gateway) Will enter 1 row in this table. -- 1) Make the DTG payment using a pre-authorized CC alias. Create row with information about the transaction. Any fields prefixed with 'Gateaway output' come directly as XML output from the XWeb Gateway. All other fields are derived by OD. The class instance will created by eConnector by deserializing an XML string as received from XWeb Gateway. The fields names MUST NOT CHANGE for this reason. XML will not deserialize if the names do not match EXACTLY.
